## 📚 EDUCATION HUB

### Pro Tips (Micro-Lessons)

**Example: "Load-In Like a Pro"**

```
🎸 PRO TIP: Load-In Like a Pro

Load-in is your first impression. Here's how to nail it:

✅ CHECKLIST:
  □ Arrive 15 min early
  □ Find load-in door (check venue card)
  □ Introduce yourself to stage manager
  □ Ask where to park van temporarily
  □ Unload fast, move van to parking
  □ Cable management: tape down your cables
  □ Respect house gear
  □ Leave space for other bands

❌ DON'T:
  × Block the loading dock
  × Move house gear without asking
  × Take up the whole green room
  × Be late (hurts your trust score!)

💡 BONUS: Bring gaff tape. Venues love it.

## 🚐 TOUR SPIDER

### The Problem

Bands want to tour but:
- Don't know where to play
- Routes are inefficient (backtracking)
- Can't find available venues
- Budget doesn't allow long drives

### The Solution

**Tour Spider** builds optimal routes within a 6-hour radius.

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with seed (SLC + date)
2. Map all venues within 6-hour drive
3. Filter by:
   - Genre fit
   - Capacity fit
   - Availability (calendar sync)
   - Trust score > 70
4. Build route graph (venue → venue edges)
5. Score paths by:
   - Minimize backtracking
   - Maximize genre fit
   - Target capacity range
   - Spread out dates (1-2 day gaps)
6. Generate 3 routes:
   - Fast: Shortest loop, fewer stops
   - Scenic: More stops, spread out
   - Big Rooms: Fewer stops, larger venues

**Output:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
    TOUR ROUTE: Fast Loop (The Red Bennies)

Total: 7 stops, 1,200 miles, 8 days
Budget estimate: $2,800 - $3,500
