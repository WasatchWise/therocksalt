      "content": "The Speedway Café was perhaps the most legendary venue in SLC's underground history. A 7,000 sq ft former warehouse at 505 W. 500 S., it operated from 1986-1990 as a refuge for punk, hardcore, and alternative music.\n\nFounders Paul Maritsas and Zay Speed obtained a rare 'brown bag' permit (BYOB) allowing alcohol and under-21 kids at the same time - an ingenious workaround to Utah's strict liquor laws that made all-ages shows possible. The venue often packed 500-700 people into a space legally meant for 290.\n\nThe Speedway hosted legendary shows: Dead Kennedys (infamous flag burning incident), GWAR, 7 Seconds, Fishbone, Soundgarden, Ministry, Circle Jerks, Minor Threat. For $5, kids could see shows from 6pm-2am nearly every night. It was a godsend for 'wayward kids with rough home lives' who found refuge there.\n\nThe venue was known for its anything-goes vibe - 'a concrete warehouse meant to be trashed' where mosh pits raged freely. It gave the '80s SLC punk/alt scene a physical home and focal point for its community.\n\nThe Speedway shut abruptly in 1990 when the building was sold. Longtime scenesters recall the closing as the day 'anarchy died in Salt Lake,' underscoring how pivotal it was. Dozens of punk kids were left 'wandering around...like they were lost.'",

      "content": "In the late 1980s, Salt Lake City became known as a hub of the Straight Edge movement (drug-free hardcore punk). Insight, formed in 1987, was SLC's first outspoken straight-edge hardcore band. Their 1989 EP 'Standing Strong' on Soulforce Records became a touchstone.\n\nInsight and contemporaries (Clear, Better Way, Reality) brought positive ideals (anti-drug, anti-racism, unity) into the punk scene, galvanizing youth. Many were ex-Mormon or non-Mormon kids in a heavily Mormon state, creating unique rebellious energy.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Utah became the 'dominant face of militant straight edge' nationally. Some militant elements committed violent acts (attacks on smokers/drinkers), drawing media attention. An 'America's Most Wanted' episode featured SLC straight-edge gang activity. FBI listed SLC straight edge as gang activity, with ties to extremist groups (ALF) and Olympic-era security concerns.\n\nBands like Clear (1995-2000) were the only Utah hardcore band well-known out of state in the '90s. Their metalcore sound influenced the national scene.\n\nToday, the straight-edge movement still exists but is far less dominant. The legacy persists in a generally supportive, substance-aware hardcore scene. One can attend SLC hardcore shows with beer now - unimaginable in the '90s.",

Local bands often play their first shows here.\n\nIn 2008, Sherburne sold to Lance Saunders and Will Sartain (S&S Presents), two local musicians turned promoters. They maintained Kilby's classic aesthetic and mission with no major changes to vibe.\n\nKilby celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2024 with the huge Kilby Block Party festival at Utah State Fairpark, headlined by The Strokes and Phoebe Bridgers. The festival (started as Kilby Court Block Party) now draws ~20,000 daily attendees and features major acts like New Order, Beach House, Weezer, Justice, while still giving local bands prime slots.\n\nKilby Court remains a cornerstone venue for fostering up-and-coming talent and serves as the first step in SLC's venue circuit: start at Kilby Court, move up to Urban Lounge or Metro, then The Depot or festivals as bands reach Gold/Platinum status.",
